					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						*The most important question to answer at the beginning of any presentation is, of course, why we bother to discuss the topic at all.* There are a few different reasons why we think that discussing research methods is helpful. Many librarians take only one research methods course in library school. Also, library research has been criticized both by librarians and other scholars for its lack of methodological rigor. Although many of us gather data and do work worth publishing, we may struggle to publish. So, talking about how to plan research projects and then write about them is important for all of us.

						The first step of planning a project is to think through the research question you would like to ask.

						To refine your question, you will need to think about what data you already have, if any, and what kind of data you would need to answer the question. For example, when we were initially planning the project to evaluate the Family Reading Room, we thought that we would learn most of what we needed to know by looking at the quantitative data we were collecting by having our patrons swipe into the room.

						However, when we looked at this data, we noticed a large percentage of the people accessing the FRR were library staff and faculty. In many ways, this makes sense. The area is an attempt to reach out to non-traditional students who may have had a hard time using library resources or felt that the library was a place in which they would have a hard time bringing their children. Our library has always tried to be welcoming to people with children, but we hadn’t previously put a lot of direct effort into building infrastructure or services to specifically meet their needs.

						So, once we noticed that the room appeared to be being used by a smaller pool of patrons, we decided we needed to gather more qualitative data about how they were using the area.

						Specifically, we decided we’d like to know:
						More about our patrons’ primary reasons for using the space
						What they like about it, and what they would change.

						Our hope was that this would help us discover what was working and what would make this area more useful to patrons. [REMIND PEOPLE TO LOOK AT HANDOUT]

					<h3><strong style="color:#aa0000">Phase 1</strong>: Determining the Research Question</h3>

						</ul>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						The first step of the process of planning a project is to think through the research question you would like to ask. This should determine the kind of research methodology you use. For example, take the age old question of whether or not all library staff are cat people by virtue of their profession. There are a few ways we could approach this question by breaking it down in to our subquestions.

						For instance, if we want to know whether more library staff own more cats than dogs, we could do a quantitative survey

						If we wanted to know whether a sample of library staff think cats are better than dogs, we would be better off conducting interviews or focus groups and analyzing that data qualitatively for themes or trends.

					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						There are two kinds of data that we tend to collect: quantitative and qualitative. **Quantitative** data asks questions like what kind or how many of something have been observed or collected.

						How many children do people who use the Family Reading Room typically have? is an example. This kind of question usually leads to generating numbers-based data

						**Qualitative** data comes from when we ask questions about how people feel or perceive the world around them.  Questions like “what do you like about the family Reading Room and What do you dislike about the Family Reading Room” are good examples. The data in this case is usually quotes or descriptions from the people who answer the question.

						The research questions one asks determines the kind of data one needs to answer the questions, and knowing the kinds of data we need then determines the methods we use to collect it.

						These two different ways kinds of data and research methodologies stem from two different ways of looking at the world: positivism and constructivism
						Positivism suggests that the natural world exists a priori, or on its own. According to this view, the best way to understand the world is to observe it and conduct experiments to understand how things work. This is the kind of logic underlying much of what we would call scientific experimentation, scientific method, or empiricism: By conducting research, we prove or disprove our educated guesses about the natural world, gradually refining our understanding of it

						The other side is constructivism. Constructivists suggest that we learn about the world by studying how we and the people that we are observing act and behave in day to day life  in the real world, outside of a lab.  The other side says that this stuff can be interpreted or made meaningful by our interaction with this stuff.

						In recent years, other forms of inquiry are appearing in the social sciences ranging from critical (feminism & race) theories, constructivist (interpretive), and participatory (post-modern).  (Lincoln, Lynham, Guba, 2011, p. 97

						Major texts about these forms of inquiry have been updated in recent years and are included in our references.

						Mixed methods straddles these two forms of inquiry  by seeking to get both quantitative and qualitative data to answer questions

					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						The next step to think about are  the resources that you have available, especially resources in terms of time, money, and staff.  You will also want to think about whether or not you have easy access to your target audience and how you plan to get it.  Lots of research projects fail because a target audience is not possible. For instance, the project we focused on, the family reading room, required that we have access to students who used the room. Since we knew that we wanted to assess the success of the Family Reading Room, we installed a card reader on the room so that we could track the IDs of the folks who used it so that we could ask them for feedback later.

						This slide suggests some questions you may want to consider as you assess your resources:
						 
						How many people will your group have who can devote time to the project?
						**Who in your group has expertise in research methods? Are you going to get outside help from people who have expertise in research methods?**
						**How are your going to deal with the interpersonal dynamics in your group?  Who is going to be the glue? the cheerleader, the organizer, etc.**
						**Who in your group will analyze the data?**
						How soon do you need an answer to the research question? (our project has taken over a year)
						Do you have money to promote the research or offer incentives?
						Do you have access to your target audiences?

					<h3><strong style="color:#aa0000">Phase 4</strong>: Creating Assessment Tools</h3>
					<ul class="color_list">
						<li><span>Create your survey questions, or interview or focus group script</span></li>
						<li><span>Create your survey questions, or interview or focus group script</span></li>
						<li><span>Make sure that the data can answer the question</span></li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						The next step is to plan the questions that you will use and make sure that the responses you receive will actually answer the questions that you wish to answer. For instance, our second survey question about the Family Reading Room asked whether or not the respondents’ use of the Family Reading Room changed the way they use library services. Without additional information, this question is not very useful: of course using a new service—the room—changed how they used the library. But, asking for qualitative follow up, we were able to elicit and  get information about exactly how their use of the library had changed beyond just using the room.

						Another way to jumpstart the process of creating your research tools is to look for other articles that answer similar questions. You can look at their methods sections to see what kind of questions they asked and use those questions to inform your own survey. My shortcut is to look at dissertations, which often have detailed methodology sections and appendices that include actual surveys. You can also look at published test instruments for ideas. (if you have questions about finding free  test instruments, the U of Utah Marriott Library has a great guide about how to do it and we are happy to help you).

						Once you have developed your questions, you should test those questions on an audience, or a willing victim. This is a good way to make sure that your potential audiences understand what you are trying to ask. For instance, one oft cited example  is a researcher who asked children the following question “ A dog had five puppies. How many puppies does she have now?” Most adults might say five, but to a child, the answer might be zero—she had five puppies before, but she has no puppies now. To get good information, one needs to creates question that participants can answer.

						Once you go through this process, you can revise as needed to make sure that your methods will provide you with the kind of data you need to answer your question. If not, be ready to revise.

					<h2>What are Focus Groups?</h2>
					<ul style="list-style-type:none; padding:0; margin:0;">

						</ul>
						<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
							Another common method for gathering qualitative research is by using focus groups. Focus groups are structured groups of participants who are guided by a moderator to discuss topics of interest to the researchers. The goal of these structured group interviews is to derive themes from the data that illustrate answers to research questions. These results can both add to quantitative data and provide information about attitudes.

						There are pros and cons to using focus groups. The pros are that it allows you to collect a lot of detailed data about attitudes and feelings in a short time. It also allows researchers to get a sense of varying attitudes in a group through comparing how the groups talk. The downsides are that it often takes some work.

						During the focus groups, there are a few options for gathering data. People that regularly conduct focus groups often have access to tools to record focus groups, and to tools that enable them to transcribe all of the data. In many cases, such as at our library, these tools are too expensive, so we rely on other tools, such as having notetakers at each session that create memos, detailed descriptions of their observations. These memos and notes then become the data that you can use to develop themes that answer your questions.

					<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
						In order to get our survey off the ground, we worked with a lot of campus partners. When we assessed our resources during Phase 3, we realized that we could work with Student Affairs to help promote our survey.

						One of first partners was the Institutional Review Board (IRB) who is responsible protecting research participants from undo harm. In a different organization this may be the responsibility of the board of trustees, administration, or general council. In our case, we received an IRB exception–which meant that the IRB chose not to do a full review. They considered the likelihood of harm to participants to be low and the results of our study will primarily be used for internal quality control, but board approval is required in order to publish our results.

						Next, we did a lot of informal research about the logistics of how surveys are generally conducted–in general and on our campus–and discovered that our Student Affairs department  had a lot of expertise in this area. They had a system in place for conducting surveys and had trained staff who understood both IRB requirements and surveys in general.
